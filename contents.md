# Populations

You have been using many objects in earlier assignments. Every string, number, set, dictionary, list, etc. is an object. But you haven't yet learned what an object actually is.

In this module you will learn a very powerful programming paradigm: object oriented programming.

Most modern programming languages provide some form object oriented programming. The main principles are similar in most programming languages, but the details might differ a lot.

In this module you'll start by learning about classes in Python. After which you will apply this knowledge to build an multi-agent system in which you simulate the interaction between foxes and rabbits.
