## Creative

### Goal

Be creative. In the previous assignments we've created a very limited world, with very limited interactions. But with this OO design it has become relatively easy to start adding more elements to the simulation to make it more realistic. Maybe rabits can get sick? Or foxes get tired and need to sleep? Or maybe rabits need to eat grass?

### Objective

* Create a file called `creative.py` 
* Add at least one entity (creature, object, etc.) and one (inter)action (e.g., eating rabits, sleeping foxes) to the existing model.
* Run expirments to see the effects of your addition.
